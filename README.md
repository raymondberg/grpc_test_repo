## Lessons Learned

  * The structure of `app/service/<autogenerated code>` worked quite well for my purposes.
    * The `from blah_pb2 import *` pattern is certainly annoying, but in general most developers don't need to/want to understand the differences between the files?
    * I toyed with `service_def` and `service` for the two auto-generated files. Doesn't feel terrific, prefer the single module.
  * I tried out [pytest-grpc](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-grpc/), it seems...not very useful?
    * The code doesn't test the server module at all, seems minimally useful
    * Never actually got integration tests running
